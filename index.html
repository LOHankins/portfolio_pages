          <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://LOHankins.github.io/Project-1">The Trivia Game</a></h2>
          <p>My very first General Assembly project.  Using Javascript to create a trivia game.  I actually had more trouble with Github than Javascript! This project gave me experience in learning about best practices in programming.  This project did not have them, just that I was learning how to implement them. I was trying to add a randomizer for the answers and a timer to limit your time with decreasing points allowed as your time to answer increased.  That is when Github and I had a disagreement!</p><br><br>

          <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://LouisHankins.com">The HWR Reunion</a></h2>
          <p>This is my first exposure to Ruby on Rails.  My outside project is for my family reunion.  Our reunion is August 2017 and I want to create a web site to manage the reunion.  Two pieces of that site will be contact information for family members and managing the reunion itinerary. These are part of my second project for my General Assembly class. Updates coming! </p>

          <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://habbywhyte.github.io/wine_up/#/">Wine Up, Wind Down</a></h2>
          <p>My third GA project was a group effort with Leland Jordan and Habby Whyte.  We created an app to match food with the proper wines.  The work was divided into HTML/CSS, Angular and the API.  My assignment was the API which including defining, creating and seeding the database.  And writing the code to respond to data requests and deliver the request in JSON format.  My intention is to continue work on this app to further my understanding of and to increase my skill level in Angular.</p>

          <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://LouisHankins.com">Cookbook</a></h2>
          <p>My fourth GA project was unfortunately a lesson in humility. I decided to do another piece of my family reunion web site.  This was going to be the cookbook app where family members could input recipes and share with the rest of the family.  I decided to write this in React which really seems like an interesting language or framework.  But I somehow managed to combine several different Gems which do not play well together.  This was discovered 24 hours before the project was due.  Consequently, I put together the  beginnings of this app in Ruby on Rails.  I intend to continue work on this in React.  Updates coming!!</p>
